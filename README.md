# PDF_Merger
If you want to merge pdfs for free, why not to try this one. Doesn't feel good to use? Revise it! Let's make it decent pdfs merger!

**How to use it?**
* **Nasty way**
* Just run python file and select pdf documents you want to merge in order all together.
* Then choose a file name.pdf and save where you want to save.
* **Nice way**
* First time you would need to run py2exe.bat which would generate a single .exe extension file in you dist folder.
* From now on you only need to run that exe file in order to run PDF merger.
* Select in order what files you want to merge and then choose a file name.pdf and save that pdf file where you want to save.

**Additional note your pip package manager or python should have PyPDF2 and tkinter libraries.**
**This merger was orignally built on Python 3.10.2, If any other version works for you, then fine you are doing great!**
